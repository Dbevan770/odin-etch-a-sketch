# odin-etch-a-sketch
Etch-a-Sketch project done during The Odin Project


# Focus
At first the project was created just to meet the MVP of what the directions outlined. I then spent a considerable amount of time re-optimizing the code for scalability. Rather than hardcode in each grid and it's dimensions the grids are created using javascript functions.

# Pages
Like most of my other projects the live version is viewable thanks to the pages hosting service from GitHub.
